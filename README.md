# 3-Column Preview Card Component

A responsive 3-column preview card component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.  
The project focuses on **semantic HTML, clean Flexbox layout logic, and maintainable CSS**, avoiding fixed heights and absolute positioning for structural layout.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- Mobile-first workflow

---

## 📐 Layout & Approach

- Mobile layout stacks cards vertically
- Desktop layout uses Flexbox for horizontal alignment
- Equal-height cards achieved using Flexbox’s default `align-items: stretch`
- Buttons aligned to the bottom using `margin-top: auto`
- No fixed heights or absolute positioning used for layout

This approach keeps the layout flexible and resilient to content changes.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- Semantic HTML elements (`main`, `article`)
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard-accessible interactive elements
- Color contrast aligned with the original design

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How Flexbox distributes space across main and cross axes
- Why equal-height cards should be handled by the parent container
- Using auto margins to control layout flow
- Separating content spacing from layout behavior
- Avoiding positional hacks in responsive layouts

---

## 🚀 Continued Development

Potential improvements:
- Add explicit `:focus-visible` styles for interactive elements
- Refactor spacing using CSS `gap`
- Improve keyboard focus visibility for accessibility
